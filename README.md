# BISI CST2101 Project - Diabetes Analysis

## Context

Diabetes is a global health concern, with an increasing number of cases reported each year in all countries around the world. The diabetes itself is not fully understood, but both genetic factors and lifestyle choices are playing a significant roles in its development.

A study conducted on the Pima people also known as the Pima Indians revealed a higher susceptibility to diabetes, particularly among females at least 21 years old. This analysis helps to explore many facets of diabetes within the Pima tribe through Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA).

## Objective

The primary objective of this project is to conduct Exploratory Data Analysis on diabetes data from the Pima tribe. The analysis will involve investigating relationships and patterns within the dataset to gain insights into the factors contributing to diabetes.

## Data Dictionary

The dataset comprises the following features:

- **Pregnancies:** Number of times pregnant
- **Glucose:** Plasma glucose concentration over 2 hours in an oral glucose tolerance test
- **BloodPressure:** Diastolic blood pressure (mm Hg)
- **SkinThickness:** Triceps skin fold thickness (mm)
- **Insulin:** 2-Hour serum insulin (mu U/ml)
- **BMI:** Body mass index (weight in kg/(height in m)^2)
- **DiabetesPedigreeFunction:** A function scoring the likelihood of diabetes based on family history
- **Age:** Age in years
- **Outcome:** Class variable (0: person is not diabetic or 1: person is diabetic)

## Getting Started

Ensure you have the necessary libraries installed before running the code. Use the following commands to install them:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy seaborn matplotlib scikit-learn
```

## Results and Conclusion

The final section provides insights into model performance, comparing a Logistic Regression model and a Random Forest model. The Random Forest model demonstrated higher accuracy on the test set, indicating better performance in predicting diabetes within the Pima tribe. The accuracy values are provided for reference.
